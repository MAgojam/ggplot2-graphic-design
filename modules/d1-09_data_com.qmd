# Recap

::: recap
-   Visualizing data is helpful to gain insights and discover anomalies
-   The design process of data visualizations can be broken down to 4 levels:
    -   **Information**: understand the data and be accurate
    -   **Story**: be clear about the message of the visualization
    -   **Goal**: select charts that successfully transport the story
    -   **Visual form**: follow design rules and data visualization principles

# Exercises

# Exercise 1

::: question
-   We form groups and each group gets a number between 1 and 10.
-   Open the image file(s) with the according number in the folder `exercises/4-1-data-communication`
    -   Discuss the visualization with regard to the 4 levels of data visualization design.
    -   Overall, do you think it is a good or a bad visualization? 
    -   What are details you like?
    -   How could one improve the chart? 
    -   Is there another (potentially better) way to tell the story? Sketch it (and think about how you could build it with ggplot2)
