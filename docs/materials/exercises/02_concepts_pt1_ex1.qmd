# Exercise 1

-   Explore the TfL bike share data visually:\
    **create a timeseries of reported bike shares on weekend days**
    -   Highlight day and night encoded by colors and shapes.
    -   Connect the points of each period with lines.
        -   What is the difference between `geom_line()` and `geom_path()`?
    -   Apply your favorite theme to the plot.
    -   Add meaningful labels.
-   Save the plot as a vector graphic with a decent plot size.
